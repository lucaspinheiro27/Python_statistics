# About
-------------------------------------
This is a side project inspired by the book Statistics All in One for Dummies by the remarkable Deborah Rumsey. Please note that this is not the official repository for the book; rather, it serves as a tribute to this outstanding resource. I am actively working on this project and will strive to update it regularly as I progress through the book. I highly recommend purchasing and reading the book, as it provides an excellent introduction to the fascinating world of statistics. The Python code in this repository is organized by chapters, with descriptions detailing the content covered in each chapter provided below.


|   Chapter   |    Topic    |

| Number Crunching basics | Focus on categorical and numerical data and use frequency tables |
