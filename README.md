# About
-------------------------------------
This is a side project I'm doing based on the book 'Statistics All in One for Dummies' written by the spectacular Deborah Rumsey. It's worth this is the official repository for the book, it's just a tribute to this fantastic book, I'm still doing the project so I'll do my best to update regularly as read the book. Also this I advise you to buy the book and read as well, it will guide you through some of the fantastic statistical world. The Python code are grouped by chapters and I will leave the description below what each chapter discuss.


|   Chapter   |    Topic    | 
|-------------|-------------|
| Number Crunching basics | Focus on categorical and numerical data and use frequency tables |
